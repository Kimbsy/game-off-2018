# game-off-2018

This is our submission for GitHub's Game Off 2018 game jam.

The theme for this year is 'HYBRID'.

Our game is Spork, a game about invention and cutlery.

Many years ago your character invented the spork. This turned out to be both immediately popular and wildly successful. Unfortunately you forgot to register a patent and so never really made any money, and more importantly you never got credit for your work.

Now you are back. Determined to come up with another game changing invention you have set up shop in your shed and are ready to work. Using only the items lying around in your shed, you have 10 attempts to come up with a new invention good enough to win you fame and glory at the upcoming World's Fair.

Select items to splice together, manipulate them with scale, rotate and crop transformations, then submit your new invention and watch the reviews and cash come rolling in.
